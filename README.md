This project presents a day planner for an 8 hour work day in which the current time is referenced through Moment.js and presented as part of the header.  Time blocks are color coded to represent the current hour's time block and differentiate it from past and future time blocks in sync with live time keeping.

I added divisions to the html provided via a Bootstrap table so that the time-blocks would sync with the CSS, which was also provided.  I have yet to set up the user input which will be saved to local storage.
